					<p class="project-category">Soft art, also known as soft sculpture or textile art, is a form of artistic expression that utilizes fabrics and soft materials to create three-dimensional artworks. It challenges traditional notions of sculpture and embraces texture, tactility, and the inherent qualities of the materials. Soft art blurs the line between fine art and craft, exploring themes like identity and domesticity. It offers a unique sensory experience, inviting viewers to engage with the artwork on a tactile level. Soft art expands the possibilities of artistic expression by elevating textiles to the realm of fine art.</p>
